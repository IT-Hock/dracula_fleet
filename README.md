> A dark theme for [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/).

## NOTE

Currently Fleet is in my personal opinion unusable. No plugins, really slow to load and a bunch of bugs. This is the reason why this theme is a WIP. Since at the moment I can not and refuse to use Fleet. Concept is cool (Jetbrains makes the best IDEs in my opinion) but the product is utterly useless right now (Oct 2023)
